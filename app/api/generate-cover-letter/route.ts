      Create a professional cover letter for the following job:
      
      Job Title: ${jobTitle}
      Company: ${companyName}
      Job Description/Requirements: ${jobDescription}

      Tone: ${tone || "professional"}
      Length: ${length || 0.5} (0-1 scale, higher means longer and more detailed)
      
      Format the cover letter professionally with proper spacing and sections. Include a header, greeting, opening paragraph, body paragraphs, closing paragraph, and a sign-off.
      
      Please focus on:
      - Matching the candidate's qualifications to the job requirements
      - Using a ${tone || "professional"} tone throughout the letter
      - Being specific about why the candidate is interested in this role at ${companyName}
      - Highlighting relevant skills and experience
      - Being concise but comprehensive
      - Avoiding clichÃ©s and generic statements
      - Making the letter compelling and persuasive
      
      The length should be appropriate for a ${length > 0.7 ? "detailed" : length > 0.4 ? "standard" : "concise"} cover letter.
