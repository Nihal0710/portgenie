## How It Works

### Data Import and Analysis

The Website Builder extracts relevant information from your existing PortGenie data, including your resume, portfolio projects, skills, and personal information. This data is analyzed and structured to determine the optimal presentation in your website.

### Design Generation

Based on your style and layout preferences, our AI generates a custom design tailored to your content. This includes responsive layouts, typography selection, color schemes, and component styling.

### Code Generation

The AI creates clean, optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that implements your website. This code follows modern web development best practices and ensures compatibility across browsers and devices.

### Optimization and Accessibility

Before finalizing your website, the system optimizes it for performance, SEO, and accessibility to ensure the best possible user experience for visitors to your site.

## Technical Implementation

The Website Builder uses a combination of technologies:

- **Frontend**: React components with form validation using React Hook Form and Zod
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Backend Processing**: Node.js with AI processing for design and code generation
- **Hosting**: Integrated with serverless platforms for one-click publishing

## Best Practices

- **Complete Your Profile**: Ensure your PortGenie profile, resume, and portfolio are complete before generating a website for best results
- **Choose Appropriate Sections**: Select sections that best showcase your specific skills and experience
- **Customize Colors**: Choose a color theme that represents your personal brand
- **Add Custom Notes**: If you have specific requirements, include them in the custom notes section
- **Review Before Publishing**: Always preview your website thoroughly before publishing

## Limitations

- Generation time may vary depending on the complexity of your data and selected options
